<!--Q5. JSX (JavaScript XML) Overview -->
<!-- What is JSX? -->
    1. Definition: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used in React to describe the UI structure.

    2. Purpose: Allows writing HTML elements in JavaScript, making the code more readable and easier to manage.

    <!-- Key Features of JSX -->

        1. HTML-like Syntax: Write HTML tags directly within JavaScript. Example: <h1>Hello, World!</h1>.
        2. Embedded JavaScript: You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces {}. Example: <h1>{title}</h1>.
        3. Component Integration: JSX is used to render React components. Example: <MyComponent />.
        4. Attributes: Similar to HTML, you can pass attributes to elements or components. Example: <img src="image.png" alt="Image" />.
        5. Conditional Rendering: You can use JavaScript logic inside JSX to conditionally render elements. Example: {isLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}.

    <!-- How JSX Works -->

        1. Compiles to JavaScript: Under the hood, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript function calls by tools like Babel. For example, <h1>Hello</h1> compiles to React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello').
        2. Virtual DOM: JSX creates elements that represent the structure of the UI in the Virtual DOM, which React uses to efficiently update the actual DOM.
        Advantages of JSX
        3. Readability: Combines the structure of HTML with the power of JavaScript, making the code more intuitive.
        4. Component-Based: Encourages a component-based architecture, where UI pieces are modular and reusable.
        5. Enhanced Development: Supports advanced IDE features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error checking.


<!--Q6. Babel overview -->
<!-- What is Babel? -->
    Definition: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write modern JavaScript (ES6+), which can then be converted into older versions (like ES5) for compatibility with older browsers.

    Purpose: Ensures that your code runs smoothly across different environments, regardless of their support for the latest JavaScript features.

    <!-- Key Features of Babel -->

    1. Transpilation: Converts modern JavaScript syntax and features (e.g., arrow functions, classes, async/await) into a version supported by older browsers.
    2. Plugins and Presets: Babel uses plugins to transform specific JavaScript features. Presets are a collection of plugins that target specific environments or versions (e.g., @babel/preset-env).
    3. Polyfills: Babel can include polyfills to add support for features not natively available in older environments, like Promises or fetch.
    4. React JSX Support: Babel can also transform JSX (used in React) into standard JavaScript, enabling the use of JSX syntax in React applications.
    
    <!-- How Babel Works -->
    
    1. Parsing: Babel reads your source code and parses it into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    2. Transforming: The AST is then transformed by applying various plugins or presets, which convert the code to the desired version.
    3. Generating: Finally, Babel generates the transformed code back into a JavaScript file that is compatible with older browsers.
    
    <!-- Advantages of Babel -->
    
    1.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensures your code runs on all browsers, even those that donâ€™t support the latest JavaScript features.
    2.Future-Proofing: Allows developers to use upcoming JavaScript features today without worrying about compatibility issues.
    3.Integration with Build Tools: Easily integrates with tools like Webpack, Vite, and others, streamlining the development process.
    4.Customization: Highly customizable with various plugins and presets, allowing developers to tailor the compilation process to their specific needs.


<!--Q7. Componets  -->

Definition: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to build complex interfaces.

Types:
    1. Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
    2. Class Components: ES6 classes that extend React.Component and include a render() method.

Reusability: Components can be reused throughout the            application, promoting modular and maintainable code.

<!--Q8. props  -->

    Definition: "Props" (short for properties) are inputs to React components that allow data to be passed from parent components to child components.

    Usage: Props are used to pass dynamic data and event handlers to components.

    Read-Only: Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the component that receives them.

Example : 

1. This is the example of Normal props
    // Functional Component ceeating 
    function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }

    // Using the Component
    function App() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Greeting name="Alice" />
        <Greeting name="Bob" />
        </div>
    );
    }

2. By Desturting 

 // Functional Component ceeating 
    function Greeting({name}) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    }

    // Using the Component
    function App() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Greeting name="Alice" />
        <Greeting name="Bob" />
        </div>
    );
    }

    Note:
    1. The props object is destructured directly in the function parameters: { name }.

    2. This allows direct access to the name prop without needing props.name.



Q9. Ternary operator ,&& operator 

1. Ternary Operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2)
    Purpose: Provides a shorthand way to write conditional statements.

const isLoggedIn = true;
const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in.";
console.log(message); // Output: "Welcome back!"

2. && Operator (Logical AND) condition && expressionIfTrue.
    Purpose: Executes the second expression only if the first expression is true.

    const showGreeting = true;
const greeting = showGreeting && "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, World!"



<!-- -------------------- Css  ---------------------->
<!-- ways of css  -->
1. Inline CSS
    Definition: Directly apply styles to React elements using the style attribute.
    Explanation: The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties.

Example:    
function App() {
  const style = {
    color: 'blue',
    fontSize: '16px'
  };

  return <p style={style}>This is an inline-styled paragraph.</p>;
}

2. Internal CSS
Definition: Define CSS rules within a <style> tag inside the component.
Explanation: Use template literals to include CSS within the component. This approach is less common but can be useful for component-specific styles.

Example:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <style>
        {`
          p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 18px;
          }
        `}
      </style>
      <p>This is an internal-styled paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

3. External CSS
Definition: Use an external stylesheet by importing it into your React component.
Explanation: Import the CSS file into your component file. This approach keeps styles modular and separate from JavaScript logic
Example:

App.css:
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}

App.js:
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return <p>This is an external-styled paragraph.</p>;
}

4. CSS-in-JS
Definition: Define styles within JavaScript using libraries like styled-components or Emotion.
Explanation: Styles are written within JavaScript files, allowing dynamic styling based on component state or props.

Example (using styled-components):
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledParagraph = styled.p`
  color: purple;
  font-size: 22px;
`;

function App() {
  return <StyledParagraph>This is a CSS-in-JS styled paragraph.</StyledParagraph>;
}

5. CSS Modules
Definition: Scope CSS to specific components using CSS Modules.

Explanation: CSS Modules automatically scope class names locally, preventing style conflicts and ensuring styles apply only to the component where they are imported.

Example:

App.module.css:
.container {
  color: orange;
  font-size: 24px;
}


App.js:
import styles from './App.module.css';

function App() {
  return <p className={styles.container}>This is a CSS Modules styled paragraph.</p>;
}


<!-- ---------------------------------events in css ------------------------- -->
CSS itself does not handle events directly. However, CSS can respond to certain user interactions and states through pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

<!-- 1. Pseudo-Classes -->
Pseudo-classes allow you to apply styles based on the state or position of an element. Some of these pseudo-classes respond to user interactions:

1. :hover: Applies styles when the user hovers over an element with a pointer device.


 button:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

2. :focus: Applies styles when an element (like an input field) is focused (clicked on or navigated to).

input:focus {
  border-color: blue;
}

3. :active: Applies styles when an element is being activated (e.g., when a button is clicked).

button:active {
  background-color: darkblue;
  color: white;
}

4. :visited: Applies styles to visited links (in conjunction with :link for unvisited links).

a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

5. :checked: Applies styles to input elements (like checkboxes or radio buttons) that are checked.


input:checked + label {
  font-weight: bold;
}

6. :disabled: Applies styles to disabled form elements.

button:disabled {
  background-color: gray;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
<!-- 2. Pseudo-Elements -->
Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element. They donâ€™t handle events directly but can respond to states indirectly:

1. ::before: Inserts content before an element's content.

.notification::before {
  content: "ðŸ””";
  margin-right: 8px;
}

2. ::after: Inserts content after an element's content.

.tooltip::after {
  content: "This is a tooltip!";
  display: block;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  padding: 4px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

<!-- 3. CSS Variables and Custom Properties -->
CSS variables can be updated dynamically with JavaScript, enabling complex interactions:

Example (JavaScript interaction with CSS variables):

styles.css:
.box {
  --box-color: blue;
  background-color: var(--box-color);
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
script.js:

const box = document.querySelector('.box');

box.addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--box-color', 'red');
});
Explanation: The background color of the .box element changes when it is clicked, thanks to JavaScript modifying the CSS variable --box-color.
